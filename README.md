# Capstone_8_bit_Computer
Here is a repository for my Senior Capstone class and my 8-bit computer

Throughout this class I will be building a 8 bit computer on a series of breadboards. I am currently almost half way thorugh my build having completed my clock, general purpose registers, and the ALU. Next I will be building the program counter, and RAM memory. 

Once I am completely done with the computer build I plan to create a compiler using lex and yacc that will convert source code into my simple as possible (SAP) ISA.
